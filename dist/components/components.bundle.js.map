instance of Date.\n *\n * @description\n * Convert the given argument to an instance of Date.\n *\n * If the argument is an instance of Date, the function returns its clone.\n *\n * If the argument is a number, it is treated as a timestamp.\n *\n * If an argument is a string, the function tries to parse it.\n * Function accepts complete ISO 8601 formats as well as partial implementations.\n * ISO 8601: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\n *\n * If all above fails, the function passes the given argument to Date constructor.\n *\n * @param {Date|String|Number} argument - the value to convert\n * @param {Object} [options] - the object with options\n * @param {0 | 1 | 2} [options.additionalDigits=2] - the additional number of digits in the extended year format\n * @returns {Date} the parsed date in the local time zone\n *\n * @example\n * // Convert string '2014-02-11T11:30:30' to date:\n * var result = parse('2014-02-11T11:30:30')\n * //=> Tue Feb 11 2014 11:30:30\n *\n * @example\n * // Parse string '+02014101',\n * // if the additional number of digits in the extended year format is 1:\n * var result = parse('+02014101', {additionalDigits: 1})\n * //=> Fri Apr 11
